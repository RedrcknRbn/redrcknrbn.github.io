I've had a mental breakdown every single night for the past 3 weeks straight, crying myself to sleep, with nothing to comfort me, and I don't even know how I can fix nor escape this bottomless pit I've dug myself into with each sentence I speak. Every decision I make is the wrong one, each word I say is the worst possible one, and I let myself suffer because of it. I don't know how to fix it, and I doubt I will ever know.</p><p>I am quite literally laying in a pit of my own tears and misery, a torture device of my own making, with a head that cannot be silenced, designed for purely the goal of self destruction. It is a miracle I have lasted this long, and I want to keep going, but, with the way I am currently going, with therapy not helping, with medicine not helping, with silence disturbed only by my own thoughts betraying me, torture appears to be my only path.</p><p>On top of this mental anguish I have inflicted upon myself, it would appear that the condition of my body itself is deteriorating further exponentially. I wake up to my muscles aching, every single joint out of place, my head throbbing, my eyes blinded from pain, and each step I take, my left foot's muscles rot even more. I lose more and more memory with each passing week, and I lose my passion to do activities I love by the month. It's difficult to do tasks that I enjoy, and so I surround myself with people to create noise, to distract myself from the withering corpse I am currently occupying.</p><p>It all appears to be coming to a head soon, and I am fearful of where I am headed, of who I am becoming, and of how I will cease. The unknowable is scary, but knowing is downright terrifying. Each day, it is seeming less and less like coincidence that every single terrible thing is being unraveled all at once, and I cannot fathom what the next few weeks has prepared for me.</p><p>This is all I can think about each and every passing night. It is near impossible for me to sleep soundly with this looping broken record destroying my psyche and very core.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn't help that, upon reflection, I have been forcing my friends into this torturous cycle of having to deal with my breakdowns, my emotions, my state. I genuinely cannot apologize enough to them that I am involving them in this. I do not deserve any single one of them, and they do not deserve what I am doing to them. They keep trying their best to help me, and I cannot thank them enough, but attempting to help me is a sisyphean task that they should not have to undertake. Every single one of them is an amazing person, and I am dragging them down with me. In all honestly, for their sakes, I should cut contact, and let myself rot. Yet, I can't bring myself to it. I don't know if I'm selfish, cowardly, or just purely lazy, but I can't let them go. I know I'm poisoning them, and I am only slowing them down from wanting to progress their dreams, but, I just can't let go. I fear being alone, despite that being what I deserve.</p><p>I fill my schedule with appointment after appointment, hoping a singular one will be my cure-all for everything I have shared, and yet, with each looming deadline, I realize now that it is not worth the effort, and that perhaps the grave is what I deserve. I only busy myself just to create distractions now, and delay me enacting a final solution, despite me knowing it will happen eventually. Only then will I finally have control over my life. It is a shame I am too cowardly to take action myself, and thus, it may not happen anytime soon, despite my constant thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot be helped, and please, don't try. I am sharing this purely so you know why I have been away for so long. You deserve to know. I've helped create stuff that you, in some way, enjoy, and it is good that I have had some sort of positive effect on your life, fleeting or long lasting, it is a good thing that you were happy for a moment due to something I made. If I do, somehow, return to normal, I hope that I am able to recreate that same impression on you again.</p><p>Thank you.</p> </article> </main> </div> </div> </div> <footer></footer></body></html>
